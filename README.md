## Motivation

Linear algebra is foundational to mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, machine learning, and graphics. However, itâ€™s often taught in a way that makes it abstract and intimidating. This project aims to bridge the gap between theory and application, making linear algebra more interactive, visual, and approachable for learners and practitioners.

---

## Features

- **Comprehensive linear algebra library** in C/C++ with clear, readable code.
- **Multiple build targets:** Native, WebAssembly (via Emscripten), and Docker.
- **Interactive web demos** (if present in `/web`) for visualizing vectors, transformations, and more.
- **Educational comments and documentation** throughout the codebase.
- **Unit tests** (if `/tests` present) to ensure reliability and demonstrate usage.
- **Modular design** for easy extension and experimentation.

---

## Concepts Covered

- **Vectors:** Representation, operations (addition, scalar multiplication, dot/cross product), linear independence.
- **Matrices:** Creation, arithmetic, transposition, inversion, special matrices (identity, diagonal, etc.).
- **Determinants & Rank:** Calculation and interpretation.
- **Systems of Linear Equations:** Solving via Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition.
- **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors:** Computation and geometric meaning.
- **Linear Transformations:** Geometric interpretation of matrices (rotation, scaling, projection).
- **Applications:** Examples in graphics, physics, and data science (PCA, transformations).

## Getting Started

### Build Instructions

#### Native Build

Requires: `cmake`, `make`, and a C compiler

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./linear_algebra
```

#### Web Build (WebAssembly via Emscripten)

Requires: [emsdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

```sh
mkdir build-web
cd build-web
emcmake cmake -DPLATFORM=Web --fresh ..
make
```

#### Docker Support

```sh
docker build -t linear-algebra:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 linear-algebra
```

---

### Running the Application

- **CLI (Native):** After building, run `./linear_algebra` in your build directory.
- **Web:** Use the Go server in `/web` to host the WebAssembly files:
  ```sh
  cd web
  go run main.go
  ```
  Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Usage Examples

- **Solving a Linear System:**
  ```c
  // Example: Solve Ax = b
  Matrix A = matrix_create(3, 3, ...);
  Vector b = vector_create(3, ...);
  Vector x = solve_linear_system(A, b);
  print_vector(x);
  ```

- **Calculating Eigenvalues:**
  ```c
  Matrix M = matrix_create(2, 2, ...);
  EigenResult result = compute_eigen(M);
  print_eigenvalues(result);
  print_eigenvectors(result);
  ```

- **Visualizing Transformations:**
  - (Web version) Visit the web interface to interactively see how matrices transform 2D/3D space.
