# Linear Algebra

How I wish linear algebra was taught.

## Building Locally (Native)

Requires `cmake`, `make`, and a C compiler

- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`
- `./linear_algebra`

## Building Locally (Web)

Requires `emsdk` [reference](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

- `mkdir build-web`
- `cd build-web`
- `emcmake cmake -DPLATFORM=Web --fresh ..`
- `make`

There's a Go application you can use to serve the files generated by the above steps (they will automatically be put in the right place). You can run it with `go run main.go`, inside the `web` directory.

## Building Locally (Docker)

- `docker build -t linear-algebra:latest .`
- `docker run -p 8080:8080 linear-algebra`
